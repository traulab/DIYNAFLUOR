This experimental design is only recommended to those who have followed the standard DIYNAFLUOR build manual and successfully verified a working unit.

This experimental design attempts to reduce fluorescent signal variance caused by optical abberations in thin-walled PCR tubes, by reducing the aperture size of the excitation and emission light paths (this results in less light interacting with the walls of the tubes). To help maintain the systems dynamic range, a TIP120 transistor circuit is also added to the system to boost LED output. Inital assessment has shown a ~350% increase in sensitivity. Increasing the LoD from 0.57 ng/µl, to 0.16 ng/µl, using Qubit HS reagents.

To build, please follow the instructions in Experimental_Build_Instructions.docx.

Please note: Experimental designs have undergone less verification and may not be stable or reliable.
