This experimental design is only recommended to those who have followed the standard DIYNAFLUOR build manual and successfully verified a working unit.

This experimental design attempts to reduce fluorescent signal variance caused by the optical differenced in thin-walled PCR tubes used by the DIYNAFLUOR, by reducing the aperture size of the excitation and emission light paths. To help maintain the systems dynamic range, a TIP120 transistor circuit is also added to the system to boost LED output. Inital assessment has shown a ~350% increase in sensitivity. Increasing the LoD from 0.57 ng/µl, to 0.16 ng/µl, using Qubit HS reagents.

Please note: Experimental designs have undergone less verification and may not be stable or reliable.
